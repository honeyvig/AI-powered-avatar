# AI-powered-avatar
To create an AI-powered avatar that recognizes student emotions, assists with tutoring, and tracks their progress, we need to combine several key AI technologies, including emotion recognition, natural language processing (NLP) for tutoring, and personalized progress tracking. This platform would require integration of machine learning models, a web interface, and tracking systems for student engagement and feedback.
Key Components:

    Emotion Recognition: Use a model to detect emotions from text or voice input. For text-based emotion recognition, you can use transformers like BERT or custom classifiers, and for voice-based emotion recognition, use pre-trained models like VGGish or openSMILE.
    AI Chatbot/Tutor: An AI model like GPT-3 or DialoGPT can handle tutoring interactions, answering student queries based on course material.
    Progress Tracking: Track and analyze student interactions, quiz results, and other data to give personalized feedback and progress summaries.
    User Interface: A web-based interface (using Flask, Django, or FastAPI for backend) and a simple front-end (React.js, Vue.js) to facilitate easy communication with the avatar.

Step-by-Step Plan and Python Code
1. Emotion Recognition with Text and Voice

To start, you can use two different approaches:

    Text-based Emotion Recognition: We can use the transformers library to classify emotions based on text input.
    Voice-based Emotion Recognition: We can use pre-trained models like VGGish or a custom model trained on speech-to-emotion datasets.

Text-based Emotion Recognition

Using a pre-trained model like BERT for emotion classification:

from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained emotion classification model
emotion_classifier = pipeline('text-classification', model='j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base')

def recognize_emotion(text):
    """Classify emotion from text input."""
    result = emotion_classifier(text)
    emotion = result[0]['label']
    return emotion

# Example usage
text_input = "I'm feeling really excited about the new lesson!"
emotion = recognize_emotion(text_input)
print(f"Detected Emotion: {emotion}")

In this example, the emotion classifier can detect emotions such as joy, anger, sadness, etc., from student input.
Voice-based Emotion Recognition

For voice-based emotion recognition, you can use a model like VGGish (which works well with speech features). Here’s an example of using openSMILE and librosa for extracting audio features and then classifying emotions:

import librosa
import numpy as np
from sklearn.externals import joblib

# Load pre-trained emotion recognition model
emotion_model = joblib.load("path_to_pretrained_model.pkl")

def extract_features_from_audio(audio_path):
    """Extract audio features from a file using librosa."""
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_path, sr=None)
    # Extract features like MFCC, Chroma, etc.
    mfcc = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=13)
    chroma = librosa.feature.chroma_stft(y=y, sr=sr)
    mel = librosa.feature.melspectrogram(y=y, sr=sr)
    
    # Combine features into a single vector
    features = np.concatenate((mfcc.mean(axis=1), chroma.mean(axis=1), mel.mean(axis=1)))
    return features

def recognize_emotion_from_audio(audio_path):
    """Recognize emotion from audio file."""
    features = extract_features_from_audio(audio_path)
    emotion = emotion_model.predict([features])[0]
    return emotion

# Example usage
audio_input = 'student_audio.wav'
emotion = recognize_emotion_from_audio(audio_input)
print(f"Detected Emotion: {emotion}")

2. AI Chatbot/Tutor

For the AI tutoring assistant, we can use a GPT-3 model to engage in tutoring tasks. The AI model can answer questions, explain concepts, and provide interactive tutoring.

import openai

openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

def chat_with_tutor(student_input):
    """Interact with the AI tutor and return the response."""
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # or another GPT-3 model
        prompt=student_input,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example usage
student_question = "Can you help me understand the Pythagorean Theorem?"
response = chat_with_tutor(student_question)
print(f"AI Tutor Response: {response}")

3. Progress Tracking

For progress tracking, we can store data such as completed lessons, quiz results, time spent on each topic, and feedback. This data can be stored in a database and used to generate personalized feedback.

import sqlite3

# Create a database or connect to it
conn = sqlite3.connect('student_progress.db')
c = conn.cursor()

# Create table to store student progress
c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS progress
             (student_id INTEGER, topic TEXT, score INTEGER, date TEXT)''')

# Function to insert progress data
def insert_progress(student_id, topic, score, date):
    c.execute("INSERT INTO progress (student_id, topic, score, date) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
              (student_id, topic, score, date))
    conn.commit()

# Function to get progress data for a student
def get_student_progress(student_id):
    c.execute("SELECT * FROM progress WHERE student_id=?", (student_id,))
    return c.fetchall()

# Example usage
insert_progress(1, 'Mathematics', 85, '2024-11-01')
progress = get_student_progress(1)
print(f"Student Progress: {progress}")

4. Integrating with Web Interface

You can create a web-based interface using Flask (or Django for more complex apps) to allow students to interact with the AI avatar. This interface could include:

    A chatbox for text input (integrating the chatbot).
    A video or audio input for emotion recognition.
    Display progress results in a dashboard format.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_cors import CORS
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    student_input = request.json.get('input')
    emotion = recognize_emotion(student_input)
    response = chat_with_tutor(student_input)
    
    return jsonify({
        'emotion': emotion,
        'response': response
    })

@app.route('/audio', methods=['POST'])
def audio_input():
    audio_file = request.files['file']
    filename = secure_filename(audio_file.filename)
    audio_file.save(f'./uploads/{filename}')
    
    emotion = recognize_emotion_from_audio(f'./uploads/{filename}')
    
    return jsonify({
        'emotion': emotion
    })

@app.route('/progress', methods=['GET'])
def progress():
    student_id = request.args.get('student_id')
    progress_data = get_student_progress(student_id)
    return jsonify(progress_data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

5. Front-End Integration

    You can integrate the chatbot, emotion recognition, and progress tracking into the front-end (React.js, Vue.js) to create a smooth and engaging user experience.
    Voice/Video: Use WebRTC or browser-based speech-to-text for handling voice-based inputs.

Conclusion:

This solution outlines the main components for building an AI avatar that recognizes student emotions, assists with tutoring, and tracks progress. The AI-driven approach includes:

    Emotion recognition (via text or voice).
    AI tutoring (via GPT-3 or another chatbot framework).
    Progress tracking (using a database to store student interactions).

The entire system can be developed using Python and web development frameworks like Flask for backend services, while the frontend can be developed with React or similar frameworks. You can further enhance the AI’s capability by training custom models or integrating advanced algorithms as needed for your specific use case.
